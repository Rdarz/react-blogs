- To start app run - npm install & npm start
- As discussed with honey wireframes not provided so designed app on assumption.
- Also blog.json not provided thats why used third party api to fetch dummy blogs data.
- Instead of plain ajax, axios used for api consumption.
- Localstorage used for store all blogs on first load.
- Filter and sortby feature also added.
- redux store used for maintain data after filter and search result.
